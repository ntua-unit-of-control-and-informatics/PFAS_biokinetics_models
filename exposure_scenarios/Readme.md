# PFAS Concentration xlsx

This xlsx file contains the data collection for the PFAS concentration in freshwater (lakes, reservoirs, ponds, rivers, streams, wetlands), sediment and soil (upper layer of soil < 20 cm). The columns of each xlsx sheet refer to the significant parameters of each study, which are:

* The PFAS chemical 
* The geographical area
* The type of media (i.e. for freshwater river, ponds etc.)
* Land use (agricultural, residential, industrial)
* The number of samples 
* The PFAS concentration (freshwater: ng/l and sediment/soil: ng/g)


The PFAS chemicals which are contained in the xlsx are: PFBA, PFBS, PFPeA, PFPeS, PFHxA, PFHpA, PFOA, PFNA, PFDA, PFUdA, PFTeDA, PFHxS, PFOS, FOSA, PFHxS, 6:2 FTSA, HFPO-DA, 6:2 FTS, PFPeS, PFNS, PFDS, PFUA, PFUdA, PFDoA, PFTrDA, PFTeDA, PFHxDA, PFODA, PFDoDA
