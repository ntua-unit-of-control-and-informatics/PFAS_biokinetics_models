# PFAS_biokinetics_models
This repository contains R code for developing biokinetics models for describing PFAS biodistribution in several environmental species and deploying as web services on Jaqpot (https://www.jaqpot.org/). This work is part of the SCENARIOS EU H2020 project (https://scenarios-project.eu/). The list of available biokinetics models will be updated throughout the lifespan of the project.
